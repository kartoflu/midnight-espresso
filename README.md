### Alternative Installation Method
In case my links in theme distribution channel are broken, you can manually install them by following these steps:
1. From this page, scroll up, click the blue "View code" line and select the *themes* folder
2. In *themes*, choose the one you want to be installed
3. When the page is loaded, click the 3 dots button on the right side of the codeblock header (the box with colorful codes), then hit Download
4. Using a file manager (ex. ZArchiver), move the downloaded theme to Aliucord > Themes

Now just restart Aliucord and enable the newly installed theme like normal.
